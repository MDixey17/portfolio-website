      <h3>ABOUT</h3>
      <p>
        Being an avid video gamer, I was always fascinated with how digital
        applications worked underneath the hood. To this point in my career,
        I've had the honor of working for{" "}
        <a href="https://www.mlb.com">America's pastime</a> and a{" "}
        <a href="https://www.target.com">Fortune 50 retailer.</a>
        <br />
        <br />
        Outside of work hours, I mentor current undergraduate Computer Science
        students at the University of Minnesota - Twin Cities to simulate
        real-world experiences while creating projects in the esports space.

        When I'm away-from-keyboard, I'm watching the Minnesota Twins, Minnesota
        Wild, or whatever team Lionel Messi plays for, going bowling with family
        and friends, playing Spikeball, and watching the latest Star Wars or
        Marvel releases.
